=========================

Description
----------------------

This directory contains the setup for a Rust cargo build. The primary source
file is:

* **src/main.rs** - the rust source code to perform the mapping replacement

The rest is pretty much just cargo boilerplate.

Building and Execution
----------------------

If you have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed, it's just a standard
build:

    cargo build
    cargo run

... of course cargo run will perform both a build and an execute step.

If you don't have rust installed, you should. [Get it here](https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html).


Both [C++](../cpp) and [Python](../python) versions are also available.

Coding Test Requirements
----------------------
The written [requirements](../README.md) for this exercise are available in
the parent directory's [README](../README.md)

Support
----------------------

If you have any questions, problems, or suggestions, please submit an
[issue](../../../../issues)
