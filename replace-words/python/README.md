replace-words/python
=========================

Description
----------------------

This directory contains 3 Python source files:

* **replace-words.py** - the main python code to perform the mapping replacement
* **tagged_sentence_tst.py** - script for testing the main TaggedSentence object
* **wordmap_tst.py - script** for testing the MapList and WordMap objects

And one soft link:
* **replace_words.py** - allows "replace-words.py" to be used as a module for
the test scripts.

If a Python interpreter is installed, all of these can be run on the linux
command line.  Note that line endings are linux style, which could might cause
a problem in Windows, as might the soft link.

Both [C++](../cpp) and [rust](../rust) versions are also available.


Requirements
----------------------
The written [requirements](../README.md) for this exercise are available in
the parent directory's [README](../README.md)

Execution
----------------------

Assuming that you have an appropriate (Python 3.x) interpreter installed, type:

    replace-words.py
