coding-tests
=========================

Introduction / Description
----------------------

Over the years, we've all been subjected to (or subjected others to) the
dreaded "coding test".  Since I have a bunch of these laying around, I decided
to throw them up on GitHub so that others could laugh at my feeble attempts.

Each of the sub-directories in this repo contains a solution, or group of 
solutions to a coding problem that was presented in a real interview.

Tests
----------------------
* [replace-words](./replace-words) - write a program that takes groups of words that each map
to a specific replacement word. Then process a sentence replacing words in
the sentence that match a word in one of the groups with the corresponding
mapped word.  Also include documentation and tests.  I did this one in both
C++ and Python. Both results are included.

* more coming soon
