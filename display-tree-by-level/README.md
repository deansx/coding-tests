display-tree-by-line
=========================

Description
----------------------

This directory contains a Python source file that implements the Requirements
specified below.

* **display-tree-by-line.py** - a Python executable that implements the test
requirements:

This code was developed using Python3 and tested on Linux using GNU tools.
Your mileage may vary on other platforms.


Test Requirements
----------------------

Given a tree data structure, print the tree one level at a time, without
using extensive secondary storage. You may use a small amount of storage to
buffer a single row at a time.


Discussion
----------------------

The script supports printing by line both from the root down (assuming an
inverted tree) and from the leaves up. 

No user input is required.


Execution
----------------------

Assuming that you have an appropriate (Python 3.x) interpreter installed, type:

    display-tree-by-line.py


Support
